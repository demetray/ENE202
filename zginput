function [pickx, picky] = zginput(x, y)
% 
% ZGINPUT: building off of MATLAB's ginput, this function allows you to zoom before selecting points while 
% using ginput. 
%
% INPUT
% x: independent variable data (vector)
% y: dependent variable data (vector)
%
% OUTPUT
% pickx: independent variable coordinates for selected points (vector)
% picky: dependent variable coordinates for selected points (vector)
%
% To succesfully zoom, select, and store points, follow these steps:
% 1. call zginput
% 2. zoom by clicking and dragging on your figure
% 3. press return key to activate ginput
% 4. execute ginput by putting cursor at desired location, and pressing any
% key (other than e or return) to store the point
% 5. repeat 2-4 for all desired points
% 6. press return, e to escape zginput
%
% Note: it is essential to select your point (step 4) by pressing a key, 
% rather than clicking with your cursor. If you use your cursor, you will 
% not be able to zoom again before selecting your next point.

% plot data on a figure, to be able to pick points from the figure
plot(x, y);

pickx = []; picky = [];


% keep selecting points from figure until e is pressed on keyboard
key = 0;
while key==0
    
    % enable zoom (to zoom in before selecting point with ginput)
    zoom on
    % after done zooming, press return key to move forward with ginput
    waitfor(gcf, 'CurrentCharacter', char(13))

    % select and store point using ginput (to store, press key, NOT mouse click)
    [xx, yy] = ginput(1);
    pickx = [pickx, xx]; 
    picky = [picky, yy];
    
    % return figure to original zoom
    zoom out
    
    % press return, e to stop selecting points (ie. to escape function; keyboard 
    % labels are just the characters ASCII code, so, char(101) == 'e')
    key = get(gcf, 'CurrentKey');
    if key == char(101)
        key = 1;
    else
        key = 0;
    end
    
end

% exclude last point (picked up when e is pressed to escape)
N = length(pickx)-1;
pickx = pickx(1:N);
picky = picky(1:N);

close all
